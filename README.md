## 📄 Creating a PR

If you don't know how to create a PR, don't worry. Here is a step-by-step procedure on how to proceed to create a PR.


**#**  Take a look at the existing or create your own issues. You can take upon an issue based on the tags or labels. Basically a label helps one to filter and catogerize a issue

**1.**  Fork repository.

**2.**  Open Git Bash.

**3.**  Clone your forked copy of the repositary.

```
git clone <link of your forked repo>
```

**4.** Navigate to the project directory .

```
cd <repo name>
```

**5.** Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.

```
git remote add upstream <original repo link>
```

**6.** Check the remotes for this repository.

```
git remote -v
```

**7.** Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project(updated repository).

```
git pull upstream master
```

**8.** Create a new branch.

```
git checkout -b <your branch name>
```

**9.** Perform your desired changes to the code base.

## 🧑‍🏫 Maintainers 

To keep the quality intact and drive the vision in the proper direction, we have maintainers.

> Maintainers are your friends forever. They are vastly different from moderators.

Currently, we have 1 active maintainer.
The task of maintainers is to review pull requests, suggest further quality additions and keep the work up to date with the current state of the world. <br/>
